# BJJ-Buddy
BJJ Buddy is an iOS app that allows BJJ practioners to journal their journey. 
This is useful to keep track of what they have learned and what they need to further work on. It also keeps lifetime stats.
There is also a round-timer for sparring/free-rolling in practice. Everything is tracked so that the user will have stats to share
to social media! #oss
